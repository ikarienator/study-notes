#### Ideal gas

Imagine a box of volume $V$ with $N$ molecules $S_1, S_2, ..., S_N$ of the same kind in them.
The total energy is $\mathscr E$ and the mass of each molecule is $m$.
The molecules do not interact with each other (meaning no potential energy) other than exchange
kinetic energy. This condition is the condition of ideal gas.

Each molecule can be described by its location $\vec x_i$ and momentum $\vec p_i$. Each a
3-vector because this discussion is non-relativistic. The energy of each molecule is
determined by their momentum $E_{S_i}=\vec p_i^2/2m$.
