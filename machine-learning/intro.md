Machine Learning Study Note - Introduction

## Types of Machine Learning Problems (wiki)

ML tasks can be classified into three broad categories based on the nature of learning signal or feedback avialable to a learning system:

1. [Supervised learning](/read.php?page=machine-learning/supervised-learning)
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

Between supervised and unsupervised learning is semi-supervised learning.

Depending on the output:

1. Classification
1. Regression
1. Ranking
1. Recommendation
1. Clustering

Also:

1. Density estimation
1. Dimensionality reduction

## Statistics
1. Paramatric methods - Methods that make assumptions that the data comes from a distribution and it intends to estimate these parameters.
1. Nonparamatric methods - Methods that does not assume certain form of distributions. (Or rather, a free-form of distributions. ["nonparametric really means many parametric."](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-parametric-model-and-a-non-parametric-model)).

## Model Selection

Hypotheses set $\mathcal H$. Bias - underfitting. Variance - overfitting. Generalization. Triple trade-of.

Cross validation. Test set. Analogy with exams.
