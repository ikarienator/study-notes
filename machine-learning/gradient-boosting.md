Machine Learning Study Note - Gradient Boosting

[Back to Intro](/read.php?page=machine-learning/intro)

Gradient boosting is an ensemble algorithm, typically of decision trees. It turns the traditional boosting methods and generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differential loss functions.

> Note: taking a boosting model and make it different-optimizable.
