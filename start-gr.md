Starting to Learn General Relativity

I was told that a physics student normal can only master either GR or QFT, but not both at the same time. It will be an interesting experiment if I can start both since I'm not in a hurry right now. So this is it. This is the textbook I will use: [General Relativity by Robert M. Wald](http://www.amazon.com/General-Relativity-Robert-M-Wald/dp/0226870332).
