### Principle of General Covariance

1. Starting from an equation that is valid in an inertial frame.
2. Generalize them using symmetry (invariance).

We used Lorentz invariant equation to describe SR previously.
In GR, we also started with a equation in an inertial frame and generalized it to an arbitrary lab frame. The difference, is that the coordinate transformation in SR is global and in GR is local. This is similar to QED. Schroedinger Equation and Dirac Equation are invariant under phase rotation. When we promote that to local symmetry in QED, that requires us to have a electromagnetic field. That's the reason when we couple the particle into the EM field, we have to change the derivative to:
$$
\partial_\mu \to \partial_\mu -\frac{ie}{\hbar c}A_\mu
$$
(This is a part that I don't understand.)

Similar to the EM field in QED, we have two field $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ and $\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu}(x)$, and they are gauge fields. They ensure that the theory has the local invariance.


We are going to use the principle of general covariance to construct equations that obeys GR local invariance, similar to what we do in QED (!!!).

# Pause

OK, let me pause it here. I'm going to move back to QED now.
