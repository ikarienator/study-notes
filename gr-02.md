### Paracompactness

**Definition (Refinement of an open cover)**: Open cover $\{V_\beta\}$ of $X$ is said to be a refinement of open cover $\{O_\alpha\}$ of $X$ if $\forall V_\beta. \exists O_\alpha. V_\beta \subseteq O_\alpha$.

> **NOTE** Refinements forms a partially ordered set. <br/>
> **NOTE** Subcover is always a refinement of a open cover. A refinement of a open cover is not always a subcover.

**Definition (Locally finite)**: $\{V_\beta\}$ is **locally finite** if each $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood $W$ such that only finitely many $V_\beta$ satisfy $W \cap V_\beta \neq \emptyset$.

> **NOTE** Comparing to compactness, compactness requires a finite subcover, locally finiteness only requires refinement.

**Definition (Paracompactness)**: A space is paracompact if every open over has a locally finite refinement.

> **NOTE**: (wiki) Every metric space is paracompact. A topological space is metrizable if and only if it is a paracompact and locally metrizable Hausdorff space. Paracompactness has little to do with the notion of compactness, but rather more to do with breaking up topological space entities into manageable pieces.

A paracomact manifold $M$ implies:

1. $M$ admits a Riemannian metric and
2. $M$ is second countable.

The most important implication is that a paracompact manifold $M$ will have a partition of unity.

**Definition (Partition of unity)**: If $(X, \mathcal T)$ is a topological space, and $R$ is a set of continuous functions from $X$ to unit interval $[0, 1]$, such that for every point $x \in X$:

1. there is a neighborhood of $x$ where all but finite number of functions in $R$ are $0$, and
2. the sum of all the functions at $x$ is $1$:
$$
\sum_{\rho\in R}\rho(x) = 1
$$

This is for the ease of defining integrals on the manifold.

### Manifold

Normally, a finite dimensional manifold can be embeded in a higher dimensional Euclidean space. Whereas such embedding might not be natural. In GR, the spacetime does not naturally live in a higher dimensional space, so an abstract definition of a manifold is necessary.

**Definition (Manifold)**: An n-dimensional, $C^\infty$, real manifold $M$ is a set together with a collection of subsets $\{O_\alpha\}$ satisfying the following properties:

1. $\{O_\alpha\}$ is a open cover of $M$.
2. For each $\alpha$, there is a one-to-one, onto, map $\psi_\alpha: O_\alpha \to U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$.
3. For each $O_\alpha$ and $O_\beta$ that $O_\alpha \cap O_\beta \neq \emptyset$, the map $\psi_\beta \circ \psi_\alpha^{-1}$ maps $\psi_\alpha[O_\alpha \cap O_\beta] \subset U_\alpha$ to $\psi_\beta[O_\alpha \cap O_\beta] \subset U_\beta$. Then both sets must be open and the map must be $C^\infty$.

Each map $\psi_\alpha$ is called a "**chart**" or a "**coordinate system**". The definition of $C^k$ manifold and complex manifold simply is the same with some natural changes.

Through out this book, the manifold involed are all assumed to be Hausdorff and paracomact.

> **NOTE** By this definition, the charts, by no means, are required to provide a "straight coordinate" to $\mathbb R^n$, by which I mean the tangent vector can change through out each $O_\alpha$.

**Example** Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$ with one chart and map to be identity function.

**Example** 2-sphere (a 2-dimensional spherical surface embedded in $\mathbb R^3$).

---

With the mapping to $\mathbb R^n$, we ca easily define differentiability and smoothness of maps between manifolds.

**Defintion (Diffeomorphism)**: Let $M$ and $M'$ to be manifolds and $\{\psi_\alpha\}$ and $\{\psi_\beta\}$ to be chart maps. A map $f:M\to M'$ is said to be $C^\infty$ if for each $\psi'_\beta \circ f \circ \psi_\alpha^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$ in Euclidean spaces. If $f$ is $C^\infty$, one-to-one and onto, then it is called a **diffeomorphism**, and $M$ and $M'$ are said to be **diffeomorphic**.

> **NOTE** diffeomorphism requires the manifolds to have the same dimension.

### Tangent vector in a manifold (without embedding in $\mathbb R^n$):

We can define tangent vectors as directional derivatives. In $\mathbb R^n$, the mapping between vectors and directional derivatives is one-to-one. $(v^1,...,v^n)$ defines derivative operator $\sum_\mu v^n(\partial/\partial x^\mu)$. Directional derivatives are characterized by **Leibnitz rules**. Let $\mathcal F$ denote the collections of all $C^\infty$ functions from manifold $M$ into $\mathbb R$. We define a tangent vector $v$ at point $p \in M$ to be a map $v: \mathcal F \to \mathbb R$ which is (1) linear and (2) obeys Leibnitz rules: $\forall f,g \in \mathcal F, a, b \in R,$

1. $v(af+bg)=av(f) + bv(g)$
2. $v(fg) = f(p)v(g) + g(p)v(f)$

**Prop**: $h\in\mathcal F,\ \forall q \in M, h(q) = c \text{ (constant) } \implies v(h) = 0$

Proof:
$$\begin{align*}
v(hh) &= 2h(p)v(h) = 2cv(h)\,,\, \text{whereas}\\
v(ch) &= cv(h)\,,\text{therefore} \\
cv(h) &= 0 \\
\end{align*}$$
If $c = 0$, $v(h) = 0$ since linearlity, otherwise divide the equation by $c$, and $v(h) = 0$.

The maps of a tangent vectors of a $p$ forms a vector space by adding this addition law: $\forall a \in \mathbb R, v_1 + av_2 \equiv \lambda h.(v_1(h) + av_2(h))$.

**Theorem 2.2.1**: Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold. Let $p\in M$ and let $V_p$ denote the tangent space at $p$, then $dim V_p = n$.

> **NOTE** simply take a chart and provide a point in Euclidean space and convert it to the manifold.
