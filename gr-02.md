### Paracompactness

**Definition (Refinement of open cover)**: Open cover $\{V_\beta\}$ is said to be a refinement of open cover $\{O_\alpha\}$ if $\forall V_\beta. \exists O_\alpha. V_\beta \subset O_\alpha$.

### Tangent vector in a manifold (without embedding in $\mathbb R^n$):

In general, curved space cannot be embedded in an Euclidean space. We can define tangent vectors as directional derivatives. In $\mathbb R^n$, the mapping between vectors and directional derivatives is one-to-one. $(v^1,...,v^n)$ defines derivative operator $\sum_\mu v^n(\partial/\partial x^\mu)$. Directional derivatives are characterized by **Leibnitz rules**. Let $\mathcal F$ denote the collections of all $C^\infty$ functions from manifold $M$ into $\mathbb R$. We define a tangent vector $v$ at point $p \in M$ to be a map $v: \mathcal F \to \mathbb R$ which is (1) linear and (2) obeys Leibnitz rules: $\forall f,g \in \mathcal F, a, b \in R,$

1. $v(af+bg)=av(f) + bv(g)$
2. $v(fg) = f(p)v(g) + g(p)v(f)$

**Prop**: $h\in\mathcal F,\ \forall q \in M, h(q) = c \text{ (constant) } \implies v(h) = 0$

Proof:
$$\begin{align*}
v(hh) &= 2h(p)v(h) = 2cv(h)\,,\, \text{whereas}\\
v(ch) &= cv(h)\,,\text{therefore} \\
cv(h) &= 0 \\
\end{align*}$$
If $c = 0$, $v(h) = 0$ since linearlity, otherwise divide the equation by $c$, and $v(h) = 0$.

The maps of a tangent vectors of a $p$ forms a vector space by adding this addition law: $\forall a \in \mathbb R, v_1 + av_2 \equiv \lambda h.(v_1(h) + av_2(h))$.

**Theorem 2.2.1**: Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold. Let $p\in M$ and let $V_p$ denote the tangent space at $p$, then $dim V_p = n$.
