Break on review of complex anlysis

I'm always amazed by my own ignorance. After some struggle of understanding the propagator, I realized that I have to go back to review the residue theorem for the moment. I'll take a break for about a week.

I believe I'm not the only person who find QFT hard, but if you're like me who haven't used any serious math for like a decade, you'll be surprised by how rusty you're when, occassianally, your friend tell you the answer of what you are struggling with by just looking at the equation for a moment. Then you can start to get frustrated and doubt about your life and the universe and such.
